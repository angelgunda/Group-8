<li> Hidalgo, Alyssa Mae [TVL - Technical Vocational Livelihood] - I chose the tvl strand because it can guide me in the course I will take when I come to college, I also chose it because I also like to discover something in the computer. </li>

<li> Aller, Angel [TVL - Technical Vocational Livelihood] - The strand I chose is TVL, as it focuses on providing students with skills and knowledge in specific technical or vocational fields such as culinary arts, automotive technology, cosmetology, and more. </li>
